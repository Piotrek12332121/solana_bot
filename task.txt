Functional requirements
Write a Discord bot in Python that
Constantly fetches spot K-line data for SOL/USDT pair from Bybit
Calculates RSI (relative strength index) for this symbol based on closing price
Sends a text message to Discord channel if the calculated RSI value is over 70 or below 30
Use the 1H (1 hour) time frame

Non-functional requirements
The code should be readable and clean but is not expected to be production-ready nor fully covered with tests.
Delay between the bar close and notification should be less than 10 seconds
RSI should be calculated using a technical analysis library of your choice
Solution should run inside the Docker container and include corresponding Dockerfile
Solution is expected in form of github repository that includes readme instructions on how to run it
